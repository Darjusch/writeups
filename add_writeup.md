## Adding your own write-up
If you want to add your own write-up/s you have to follow these steps: <br>
 1. Read the [rules](./rules.md)
 2. You have to use MarkDown for creating writeups 
 3. Every image you use should be uploaded to /images and if you want to upload a screenshot of the ouput of an tool create a dir for that tool for example `/images/nmap/your_file`
 4. Create a [PullRequest](https://github.com/T3n4ci0us/writeups/pulls)
    - If you are the first to upload one to a CTF just create the dir with the PR (if it doesn't exist)
 5. A member from this organisation will read the write-up and correct mistakes (if there are ones)
 6. If there is a mistake correct it (if there aren't any mistake skip this step)
 7. Write-up will get merged
