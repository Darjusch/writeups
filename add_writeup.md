## Adding your own write-up
If you want to add your own write-up/s you have to follow these steps: <br>
 1. Read the [rules](./rules.md)
 2. Create a [PullRequest](https://github.com/T3n4ci0us/writeups/pulls) 
  - If you are the first to upload one to a CTF just create the dir with the PR (if it doesn't exist)
 3. A member from this organisation will read the write-up and correct mistakes (if there are ones)
 4. If there is a mistake correct it (if there aren't any mistake skip this step)
 5. Write-up will get merged
